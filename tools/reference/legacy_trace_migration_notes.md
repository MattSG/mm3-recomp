# Historical tracing migration notes

Original runtime introduction, retained as migration history rather than a
current coverage or support claim:

```text
 * recomp_types.h declares these and tools.recomp emits calls to them under
 * --trace-functions, but until now nothing defined them: the definitions lived
 * in one game project, so enabling tracing anywhere else failed at link time
 * with three unresolved symbols and no hint that the fix was to go and copy a
 * file. They belong with the runtime that declares them.
 *
```
