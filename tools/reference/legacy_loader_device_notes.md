# Historical loader and device observations

These captured image addresses, title failures and obsolete device descriptions
are preserved as normalized text. They are historical evidence, not current
compatibility guarantees. Runtime code is unchanged by this comment migration.

```c
/*
     * Parse the kernel thunk table address from the XBE header.
     * The XBE stores KernelImageThunkAddress at offset 0x0158, XOR-encrypted.
     * The key differs between retail and debug XBEs, and there is no flag
     * saying which was used -- decode with both and keep whichever lands in
     * the mapped address range (this is what tools/xbe_parser does).
     *
     * Debug XBEs are not an edge case here: they are the builds most worth
     * recompiling, since they still carry assert strings and symbols. Halo's
     * cachebeta.xbe is one, and assuming the retail key decoded its thunk
     * table to 0xB4F98174 instead of 0x00253090, which silently fell back to
     * the compile-time default and resolved 0 of 378 kernel imports.

```

```c
/*
     * NOTE: .rdata is NOT set read-only.
     * VirtualProtect rounds to page boundaries, and the .rdata end (0x003B2454)
     * and .data start (0x003B2360) share the same 4KB page (0x003B2000-0x003B2FFF).
     * Making .rdata read-only also makes the first ~0xCA0 bytes of .data read-only,
     * which causes game initialization code to fault when writing to .data globals
     * in that overlap range.
     */
```

```c
/*
     * Contiguous / physical memory window at 0x80000000.
     *
     * MmAllocateContiguousMemory hands back addresses in this window: physical
     * page P is visible at 0x80000000 + P. Titles that pin buffers at fixed
     * physical addresses then use the whole range, so it has to be backed for
     * its full length - Halo pins 3.4 MB at 0x61000 and 22 MB at 0x3A6000, and
     * with only the fake kernel page mapped here a write walked off the end of
     * it a few pages in.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT a view of the 64 MB RAM mapping. On hardware this window
     * aliases physical RAM, but we load the XBE image into the low addresses of
     * that same region, so aliasing would put a title's pinned pools on top of
     * its own code. Separate storage costs an extra mapping and behaves
     * correctly; nothing here depends on the aliasing.
     *
     * Reserved before the kernel page below, which lives inside it.

```c
/*
     * NV2A hardware register aperture at 0xFD000000 (16 MB).
     *
     * The GPU's registers are memory-mapped here on real hardware. A title
     * that only calls D3D never notices, but the D3D8 library is linked into
     * the XBE rather than provided by the kernel, so once execution is inside
     * it the register pokes are just loads and stores in recompiled code.
     * Halo faults reading 0xFD001804 during rasterizer_preinitialize, a few
     * instructions after Direct3DCreate8 returns.
     *
     * Backed as ordinary zeroed RAM. That is enough to get through
     * initialisation, and reads returning zero are the benign answer for the
     * status and capability registers touched here.
     *
     * ponytail: plain memory, no register semantics. A spin loop waiting for
     * a bit to *set* would hang rather than fault -- if that shows up, the fix
     * is to bridge the D3D8 entry point that owns the loop, not to start
     * emulating NV2A. Nothing has needed that yet.
     */
```

```c
/*
     * MCPX device apertures.
     *
     * The NV2A block above is not the only hardware the title touches
     * directly. The southbridge devices live higher up:
     *
     *   0xFE800000  APU (audio processing unit)
     *   0xFEC00000  AC97
     *   0xFED00000  USB0 / USB1
     *   0xFEF00000  NIC
     *
     * Halo faults reading 0xFED00000 during input initialisation -- the XDK's
     * USB code talks to the host controller's registers rather than going
     * through a driver. Back the whole span as plain RAM for the same reason
     * the NV2A aperture is backed: a read of zero is survivable, a fault is
     * not.
     *
     * ponytail: no register semantics anywhere in here. If something spins
     * waiting for a bit to set, extend the NV2A ack thread's table rather than
     * emulating the device.

```c
/* AC'97 codec ready.
             *
             * DirectSound resets the codec by setting a bit in 0xFEC0012C and
             * then polls 0xFEC00130 for bit 8 a thousand times waiting for the
             * codec to come up. On zeroed registers that bit never appears, so
             * the wait times out and DirectSoundCreate returns DSERR_NODRIVER
             * (0x88780078).
             *
             * That failure is not confined to audio. Wreckless initialises its
             * whole engine object behind `if (DirectSoundCreate() >= 0)`, so a
             * failed create skips the initialisation, leaves the object's table
             * pointer null, and the null propagates: a null-derived divisor
             * produces a NaN transform matrix, which produces a garbage index,
             * which crashes. Reporting the codec as present is what lets the
             * engine initialise at all.
             *
             * The aperture is plain memory, so setting the bit once is enough:
             * nothing clears it, and the poll reads it on the first pass. */
```

```c
/* Opt-in, and not because it is wrong.
             *
             * Reporting the codec is the correct answer -- DSERR_NODRIVER is
             * not what hardware returns -- but it is only correct as far as it
             * goes. DirectSound then hands the audio DSP a command block in
             * RAM and spins until the DSP clears it, and there is no DSP here,
             * so the title trades a late crash for an early hang: 44 assets
             * loaded and then a fault, versus one asset and a stall in audio
             * init. Until the DSP handshake is answered, the honest default is
             * the failure that gets further, with the correct behaviour one
             * variable away. */

```c
/*
     * Reserve the slots above the mapped range. They are not mapped.
     *
     * Each slot is map-sized and sits at a multiple of the mapped size. They
     * used to be mapped as views of the RAM, so a guest address there read low
     * memory: with a 128 MB map, 0x08000000 read 0x00000000. The console does
     * not do that. The CPU translates a virtual address through page tables,
     * and a page with no entry faults. The 26-bit bus wrap is a property of
     * physical addresses, and the physical RAM the guest can reach is the
     * contiguous window at 0x80000000. Half-Life 2 and Halo both built corrupt
     * structures on the alias (4e03cab, 5362bc3, aa812ee), so the slots stay
     * out: an access there faults, and the fault handler names the address.
     *
     * With the placeholder span the reservation already exists. Without it,
     * reserve each slot here, skipping the tiled aperture (mapped later) and
     * the contiguous window (mapped later too).
