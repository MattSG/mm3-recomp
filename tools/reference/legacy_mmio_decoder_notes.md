# Historical MMIO decoder extraction notes

Original shared-decoder migration narrative. This records implementation
history, not current caller coverage or instruction-semantic proof.

```text
 * That decoder existed twice before this file -- once in nv2a_mmio_hook.c and
 * once in apu_mmio_hook.c -- as the same opcode table written out against two
 * different pairs of accessors. This is the same logic with the accessors
 * passed in, so a third device does not need a third copy. The two originals
 * still carry their own and can move onto this whenever they are next touched.
