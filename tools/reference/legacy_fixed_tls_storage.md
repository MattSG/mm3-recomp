# Historical fixed main-thread TLS storage

Source: XboxRecomp `e046797aa44ef2ffb033231c26dfcceb3e09f01e`, `src/kernel/xbox_memory_layout.c`.
The original bootstrap below used fixed buffers 512 bytes apart. Current
shared loading allocates image-derived TLS and thread data together through
the owned heap, avoiding loaded-section overwrite and template overlap.

```c
        /*
         * XBE TLS directory.
         *
         * An image with __declspec(thread) data carries one, and on hardware
         * the loader acts on it. Nothing here did, so thread-local access read
         * whatever memory happened to be under fs:[4].
         *
         * Xbox reaches thread-local data through NtTib.StackBase -- fs:[4] --
         * not Win32's fs:[0x2C], and the block sits BELOW that pointer: the
         * image's entry point computes its own index, negative, as
         * -(blocksize/4). The loader's block placement and rounding must
         * match that guest index calculation.
         *
         * The index itself is deliberately NOT written here: the title
         * computes and stores it. What the loader owes it is a block in the
         * right place.
         *
         * Slot 0 holds a pointer to per-thread data -- XAPI's SetLastError is
         * [[fs:[4] + index*4] + 4] = err -- so it gets a zeroed block rather
         * than being left NULL, which had SetLastError writing the error code
         * over fs:[4] itself and the next call faulting at guest 0xFFFFFFEF.
         *
         * ponytail: one block for the whole process, not one per thread.
         * Every guest thread therefore shares LastError. Give this a per-thread
         * allocation when a title is observed to care.
