# Historical worker stack policy

Source: XboxRecomp `3cabda4d487b5ff626bfe393b82d775a78b1b8e9`.
The fixed 512 KiB/eight-worker allocator, guessed free arithmetic and silent
inline fallback follow as normalized reference evidence. MM3 explicitly keeps
512 KiB minimum headroom; generic allocation is request/image-derived and owned.

 *
 * The counter used to only ever go up, so a title that creates and destroys
 * threads ran the pool dry no matter how few were alive at once. The Xbox
 * Dashboard spawns one worker per ambient WAV and terminates it before loading
 * the next; after XBOX_MAX_THREAD_STACKS files the pool was empty and
 * PsCreateSystemThreadEx fell back to running the worker inline. That fallback
 * is a deadlock here rather than a slowdown: the worker ran to completion
 * before the caller reached its wait, so the main thread then waited forever on
 * events whose only signaller had already finished. It looked like an audio
 * hang, three layers away from the cause.
 *
 * Takes the value AllocThreadStack returned, so callers never do the arithmetic.
